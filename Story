# Story: Upload Excel File to Populate KPI Tables in SPA

**Story Description (As a / I want / So that):**  
As a **pricing governance user**  
I want to **upload an Excel file containing KPI tables**  
So that **the SPA can automatically display the KPI principles, descriptions, and table data without manual data entry**.  

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **File Upload Control**  
   - Given I am on the SPA page  
   - When I click the **Upload File** button and select a `.xlsx` file from my desktop  
   - Then the system should parse the file client-side without uploading it to a server.  

2. **Sheet Handling**  
   - Each worksheet in the Excel file must be displayed in the SPA.  
   - The worksheet name should be displayed as a section heading.  

3. **Description Handling**  
   - The text in **cell A1** of each sheet must be displayed as a description (italicised under the sheet title).  

4. **Table Rendering**  
   - The table header (row 2) and all subsequent rows must be rendered as an HTML table.  
   - Empty cells should render as blank.  

5. **Supported Formats**  
   - Only `.xlsx` and `.xls` formats should be accepted.  
   - If a different file type is uploaded, show an error message.  

6. **Usability**  
   - Tables should be scrollable if they overflow the page.  
   - Large files (up to at least 5 MB) must be handled without crashing the page.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Parsing must occur entirely in the browser (no backend dependency).  
- The implementation should use a stable library (e.g. SheetJS).  
- Rendering should degrade gracefully if the file contains unexpected formatting.  

---

## Out of Scope (for this story)
- Saving uploaded files for reuse.  
- Editing or exporting data back to Excel.  
- Collapsible/expandable views (separate story).  

---

## Dependencies
- SheetJS (xlsx library) included via CDN or package manager.
